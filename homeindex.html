                <p>Rock paper scissors is a game we all played as kids, but now you can play this game with your little boy or girl to teach numbers and counting.</p>
                  <b>What you do:</b><br>
                  The game is played like rock, paper, scissors, only instead of rock-paper-or scissors with your two fingers, you can show a number.<br>
                  On the count of three, you and your child can put up as many fingers as you want.<br>
                  Then ask the kid to count the number of fingers you are showing and how many they have.
                  <br>What kids learn: Counting

                <p>As a child, I remember playing connect the dots. What's great to know now is you can use this same game to teach number sequence.</p>
                <p><b>Here's how:</b><br>Print out a few paint-by-number templates, grab some crayons or paint to use for coloring.</p><br>
                pick an easy model, an image with fewer but larger sections that a child can paint easily.
                Sit with the child and tell him what he needs to do. Show him by coloring a numbered part of the template.
                Ask the child to pick a number next and check for the corresponding color on the sheet.
                Color the template fully.<br>
                <b>What they will learn:</b> Number recognition and one-to-one correspondence
